# LDN-House-Future-Predictor

This Repo showcases a project I am building involving ML models to predict future house prices in London

I have borrowed this dataset from kaggle

All required dependencies are found in requirements.txt

I have used a linear regression model for this task. I want to use another model, with the random forest classifier to predict house prices, and then compare the two models to find out which model is the most accurate.

Enjoy :)
