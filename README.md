# LDN-House-Price-Predictor

This Repo showcases a project I am building involving ML models to predict house prices in London

I have borrowed this dataset from kaggle

All required dependencies are found in requirements.txt

I have used both a linear regression model and the random forest regressor model to perform this task of predicting house prices.

I have discovered that the random forest model is more accurate than the linear regression model, with an R2 value of 0.88 compared to 0.82

Enjoy :)
